# Communication
Slack is our primary communication method. Slack communication can be used at any time although if it is sent later in the evening/ at night these messages may not get answered until the next day. Weekend communication is also allowed but due to people working and having other commitments not everyone will be able to answer the questions in a timely manner and therefore for numerous reasons a message sent on the weekend may not get answered until Monday. When an issue is discovered make it known ASAP. All team documents are to be created using Markdown language and shared on GitHub. If slack is unavailable for any reason throughout the duration of the project, emails will be used. No question is a silly question, everyone should feel safe to ask any questions or express any concerns problems or opinions they have. Everyone should have equal opportunity to receive help from the team and if no one can help we will work together to work out the issue. Everyone should respect and feel respected by every member of the team. When someone is speaking the rest of the team will listen. There will be no disrespect of any kind.

# Agile way of working.
If are assigned a job, take ownership of it, and keep it up to date. Stick to your agreed working patterns. Let the team know when you are late or going early. Keep JIRA board always updated. Update the Scrum Board as you progress the story i.e., don’t update at stand-up. Don't be afraid to ask for help. Don't be afraid to give constructive criticism if it is constructive. Solve roadblocks within the team. If the impediment can’t be solved within the team then give it to the Scrum Master. 

Other Sprints will start Wednesdays at 11:00. The Scrum Master role rotates each week, the schedule is available on the on the process section slack and GitHub project board will be used for task management and planning. Each member of the team will work couple hours per week unless they are on vacation. Branching Strategy is each member will create new branch to work on and then merge back into main branch after it is checked from a member of the team.

# Estimating Story Points
The team's velocity is calculated by the number of story points we achieve on average in the previous sprints.

The teams current story point velocity is "10 story points per sprint".
