Team Review

Everyone talks about their own pushes/code
What went well?
What went bad?
What would you improve?

John
I created and pushed the initial code (CustomerLogin.java) as well as the registration confirmation email java file to the repository on GitHub.
I also created a file where the admin can get user details and also created a ViewGrantOptions java file with an accompanying Junit test that worked successfully.
•	What went well?
o	Everyone that shows up to the meetings and class puts in the work and communicates on Slack.
•	What went bad?
o	Initially git commands and setting up the testing project.
•	What would you improve?
o	We could be a bit more organised with the repository, everything is clumped together but knowing the team we can fix that.
Paul
•	I created the database with tables customers, grants and grant status also had values in txt file for customers and grant
•	I helped john on his part for the user credentials check if credentials are valid
•	I created a java file to check the grant statues and connected to the database that Luke have already created and pull from table just reusing code but different SQL command

•	What went well?
o	Our team meeting as if anyone needs help can get it and information is clear then between all members of the team
•	What went bad?
o	My self is not great with remembering all the git commands and just bit tricky 
•	What would you improve?
o	Knowledge of how to be better with GitHub and all commands and branching would help the overall team.

Luke
•	I created a java file which connects to the database
•	I improved the database by creating data in the tables

•	What went well?
o	Creating of the database and connecting it to the java file
•	What went bad?
o	I struggled at the start with using the git commands in the command line when pulling and pushing the project
•	What would you improve?
o	Overall communication as a team, we need to let each other know if we cant go in and update each other better on what work we have done.
