Static Analysis of code

PMD was ran on the CustomerInformation.java file and a series of flags that are colour coded

It noted multiple issues with the provided code of the green and cyan level.
2 of these noted issues included:
The input stream should be closed when its use is complete. 
Multiple variables can be defined as final and declaring local variables as final that do not change is more secure.

SpotBug was ran on on a sample piece of code and 92 bugs were found, each of which was sectioned into levels of importance, these levels of importance include
Scary
Troubling
Of Concern

A scary bug that was noticed is that the database login was hardcoded, before the project is pushed to the public and has entered the testing stage this login information being
hardcoded should be altered so that login information has to be provided each time by the user.

A Screengrab of both of these bug report pages are available in this same folder as the text document.
